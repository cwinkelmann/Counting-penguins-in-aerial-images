# Counting animals in aerial images with a density map estimation method
------------------
This repository contains the code used in the paper 'Counting animals in aerial images with a density map estimation method'. Our method achieves a significant improvement in counting accuracy compared to the traditional two-stage detection method, Faster-RCNN when processing low-resolution aerial images. Here, we provide the official implement of our method.
